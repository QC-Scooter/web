Today, Canvas+ has been updated to version 0.4.2 which includes a _quiz refill_ feature. Our goal with this feature is to improve productivity, but this could readily be abused in certain situations.

This blog post discussing measures we've taking to prevent abuse, and measures teachers can take to prevent or detect abuse.

**First — Quiz Refill**

Quiz refill lets you import answers from your previous attempts so you can focus on the questions you missed, not the ones you've mastered.

Users with the feature enabled will get the popup below provided that:

- They've already taken the quiz and are on another attempt
- The quiz allows students to view missed questions
- They accept the academic honesty warning

<br>

**Measures we're taking**

Firstly, this feature only works if students are allowed to view their missed questions. It doesn't do anything a student without Canvas+ _couldn't do_, it merely does it automatically.

When a student choses to use this feature, they'll recieve a prompt confirming they're following their school's Academic Honesty guidelines, shown below.

If a student confirms this, Canvas+ logs this in the settings page if it's needed for future audit. Teachers can check to see if Quiz Refill was used in their class by searching through a student's audit log.
To find the audit log on a student's computer:

1. Open the settings page by clicking the "Settings" button on the sidebar. If a student has this button disabled, you can access the settings page via the _extensions menu_, shown below.

2. Click on the _Canvas+ logo_ at the very top of the Settings page, shown below.

3. Click the button that says "Quiz Refill Audit Log" to access the audit log.

**Measures you can take**

If you don't want students using this feature, you can turn off the _View Missed Questions_ setting when making your quiz, shown below. Turning on "Only Once After Each Attempt" _or_ turning off "Let Students See Their Quiz Responses" will bar students from using Quiz Refill.
