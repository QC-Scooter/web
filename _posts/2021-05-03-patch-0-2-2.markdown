Canvas+ version 0.2.1 was intended to fix the issue of the search bar not working. While this fixed the issue for some users, others continued having this issue. This most likely affected you if one of your courses had the modules feature disabled. This update should fix the issue. If you still have an issue with the search feature, please sumit an issue by clicking on the Contribute button.

Lastly, a few small improvements have been made to dark mode:

- Mathematical equations will appear in white, previously black
- Some elements on the dashboard had a white backgroud, now fixed
